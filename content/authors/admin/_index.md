Welcome on my personal website, thanks for taking a look! I am at the moment constructing this website so just noting here that it is not complete yet!
I am a researcher interested in the governance of common pool resources and the interactions between humans and their
environment. 

During my education I focused specifically on coastal and marine systems, anthropogenic impacts
on the ecological functioning of these systems and ecological and socio-economic impacts of management
measures. I have experience collaborating with those from the fields of social sciences and natural sciences and
as an interdisciplinary marine scholar move between those fields, in a team-setting. I’ve strongly grounded myself
in quantitative methods, using network analysis, statistical modelling, dynamic ecosystem modelling and remote
sensing. More recently I’m also gaining experience in qualitative methods, through an interview campaign and
the organisation of stakeholder workshops.
Recent areas of research:

• Social-ecological modelling of a potential fishery in the ocean twilight zone and impacts on fish
contributions to carbon cycling, combining qualitative interview data and quantitative data

• Classification of global fisheries management systems and their relation to outcomes for marine populations using statistical modelling

• Statistical modelling of global trade impacts on marine population status

• Ecological modelling of global change drivers in the Icelandic ecosystem

• Statistical and network modelling of socio-economic impacts and drivers in the Icelandic fisheries system
